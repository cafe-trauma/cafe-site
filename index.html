                <h2>Comparative Assessment Framework for Environments of Trauma Care</h2>
                <p>We propose to develop a semantically driven, web-based IT framework that will (a) allow comparison of organizational structures of trauma centers and trauma systems and (b) collect data about the organization of trauma centers and trauma systems. Our first goal is to enable representatives of trauma care environments and verification/consultation bodies to use our framework for computer-assisted assessment of trauma care organizations. Our second goal is to support public health researchers by providing them access to the knowledge accumulated through verification and consultation processes. Currently, little is known about which structures and processes of trauma systems and trauma centers lead to optimal care for the injured patient, yet the role of structure in influencing performance has been widely recognized in the healthcare industry. One reason for this gap in knowledge is that, despite a strong regulatory framework, we lack unified, machine- interpretable models of the organization of trauma centers and trauma systems to foster comparability between different instances of each type of organization. Our proposed web services will be based on such a machine- interpretable model, which we propose to develop as an ontology of trauma center and trauma system organization under Aim 1. Within the domain of biomedicine, issues related to comparability have already been successfully addressed with ontologies-logical models of the components of a domain and their interrelations that are coded in a machine-interpretable language.</p>
